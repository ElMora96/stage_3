Python Load Forecasting project - Stage 3

This project consists in the development of some non-conventional, short-term electric load forecasting models. 
Modules in folder 'libs' provide concrete implementations of two models, namely:\
1)A model based on Clonal Selection Artificial Immune System (ais_lib) \
2)A hybrid model based on STL decomposition, Exponential Smoothing and Random Forests (stl_rf_lib).\
Moreover and experimental model for forecasting trends (trend_lib) and a module with some utilities are present.
